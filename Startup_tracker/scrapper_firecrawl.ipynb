      "Autonomous vehicle startup Argo AI shut down at the end of October. Having just launched a suite of commercial delivery and robotaxi solutions the month prior, the news came as a surprise to many that had been watching Argo’s rise to prominence. In 2017, just a year after it was founded, the company emerged from stealth with a $1B capital commitment from Ford. Two years later, it entered the unicorn club with a $7.3B valuation. In the time that followed, the company reportedly found it difficult to secure new investors amid slow progress toward the commercialization of autonomous driving technology. This led Ford and Volkswagen, its main backers, to shift their strategic focus away from the startup.\n",

That eventually led to Dine In being approached in February by a major Internet company active in the online food space, and it’s my understanding that by April — and significant legal fees later — a sale had been agreed. Then at the eleventh hour the deal unexpectedly fell through, leaving the restaurant delivery startup “high and dry” and its unnamed acquirer a “no-show”. Adds Graj: “They backed out leaving us with a huge legal bill both for Dine In and myself personally, a huge debt to note holders, and no VCs to turn to. A hard lesson to learn and one I’ll be taking into my next venture.”\n",

Furthermore, founders become highly emotional about their companies. Thus, the process of negotiating taking back stock from founders is not rational and inherently very difficult. However, vesting schedules reduce the difficult negotiation to simply and mechanically exercising the companies pre-agreed right to repurchase stock at the price it was issued. I foolishly let myself fall into the “it won’t happen to me” trap but no startup gets it right on the first try and theses hiccups often lead to changes in the team.

Its momentum culminated in April 2022, when payments company Bolt Financial agreed to acquire the startup for $1.5B to build digital checkout solutions. However, Bolt scrapped the deal the following September. Since then, the crypto market has seen a number of high-profile bankruptcies and a regulatory crackdown — though Wyre cited market conditions, rather than regulatory pressure, as driving its decision to close.\\n\\nThe company commented on the closure in a blog post:\\n\\n> “After nearly a decade, Wyre is winding down. Due to market conditions, we made this decision to protect the best interest of our key stakeholders and customers. This decision is not due to any regulatory agency direction.\\n>\\n> Wyre continues to secure customer assets. If you have assets on the Wyre platform, you can continue to withdraw them via Wyre’s dashboard until Friday, July 14th.”\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### **Summation Bio**\\n\\nTitle: [RA Capital-backed gene therapy startup Summation Bio shuts down](https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2023/06/01/ra-capital-summation-bio-shutdown-closure.html?ana=RSS&s=article_search)\\n\\nProduct: [Summation Bio](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/summation-bio)\\n\\nGene therapy biotech Summation Bio closed down at the beginning of June 2023. The company raised around $25M on its quest to develop non-viral gene therapies for a wide variety of diseases. Ultimately, research and development efforts revealed that the company’s therapies wouldn’t work as expected, leading it to close its doors.\\n\\nThe Boston Business Journal reported,\\n\\n> “A Cleveland-based biotech senior program director at Summation, Chris Hanff, posted on LinkedIn last week that the startup was ‘over as quickly as it began,’ citing ‘circumstances insurmountable’ — that is, the science just didn’t pan out.\\n>\\n> ‘Despite all-out effort and error-free execution, the science, this time, was elusive,’ Hanff wrote. ‘Acceptance that we did all that we could means not anguishing about what could have been. Acceptance to stop looking at the past and instead look forward.’”\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### **Seeker Biologics**\\n\\nTitle: [5AM Ventures-backed biotech startup shuts down](https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2023/05/01/seeker-biologics-fleet-therapeutics-shuts-down.html)\\n\\nProduct: [Seeker Biologics](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/fleet-therapeutics)\\n\\nSeeker Biologics — a 5AM Venture spinoff focused on biologics for autoimmune, allergic, and inflammatory diseases — shuttered operations in April 2023. The company, formerly known as Fleet Therapeutics, initially raised $24M at a $74M valuation in 2021. However, the company fell short of its drug discovery goals. While specific reasons beyond the decision were not disclosed, former employees shed some light on what happened behind the scenes.\\n\\nIn a LinkedIn post, a former Seeker VP and head of biology stated,\\n\\n> “It can be challenging to witness a talented team dedicated to discovering new medicines fall short of their ambitious goals in a demanding market. However, science doesn’t always take us in the direction we expect, nor does it adhere to our timeline. Yet, it can lead us to exciting new discoveries, inspiring us to keep pursuing breakthroughs with renewed vigor.”\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### **Tessera**\\n\\nTitle: [Paradigm-Backed NFT Ownership Platform Tessera is Shutting Down](https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2023/05/12/paradigm-backed-nft-ownership-platform-tessera-is-shutting-down/)\\n\\nProduct: [Tessera](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/fractional-1), Escher\\n\\nNFT trading platform Tessera said farewell in May 2023, after raising $22M from Paradigm and other investors. In a Tweet announcing the closure, Tessera co-founder Andy Chorlian identified the company’s structure and financial situation as factoring into the decision. He also stated that Tessera would also be shutting down Escher — a digital fine art marketplace project in its portfolio. Chorlian shared that the company simply didn’t have the time and resources to scale Escher to the point of profitability.\\n\\nCoindesk wrote,\\n\\n> “Tessera, a protocol that enables collective ownership and governance of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), is winding down its operations over the next few weeks, co-founder Andy Chorlian tweeted on Friday.\\n>\\n> Chorlian, who co-founded the company alongside Nejc Krajnik in 2021, said that the decision was made after ‘carefully analyzing possible market scenarios, our company structure and our financial situation.’”\\n\\n* * *\\n\""
